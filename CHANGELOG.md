All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.5.7] - 2026-04-27

### Added
- **Multi-Agent Awareness (`omni_agents`)**: New MCP tool allowing agents (e.g., Claude, Cursor, Copilot) to discover and interact with each other's state on the same project.
- **Persistent Project Knowledge (`omni_knowledge`)**: Cross-session memory for agents to permanently learn and store project-specific quirks and filter preferences.
- **Advanced ROI Diagnostics**: Added `omni_history` (distillation log) and `omni_budget` (ROI simulator) MCP tools directly to the agent toolkit.
- **Meta-Harness Outer Loop**: Implemented `omni optimize` to automatically validate generated LLM filters.
- **Non-Bash Tool Distillation**: Expanded engine routing for `ReadFile`, `Grep`, and `WebFetch` output.
- **Distiller Context Preservation**: Added `-->` contextual error block preservation to the Build and Test distillers.
- **Extended Hook Architecture**: New async hooks for `SessionEnd`, `PostToolUseFailure`, `FileChanged`, and `SubagentStart`.
- **Antigravity IDE Integration**: Native MCP server bindings for Google's Antigravity environment (`~/.gemini/antigravity/mcp_config.json`).

### Improved
- **Positional Scorer Boost**: Dynamic positional-based priority bumping for active errors in multi-line outputs.
- **Passthrough Visibility**: Short or low-compression outputs are now explicitly labeled with `[OMNI: Passthrough]` rather than silently omitted.

## [0.5.6-rc3] - 2026-04-14
- **Database Distiller**: New `DatabaseDistiller` for intelligent distillation of PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite CLI output — strips verbose headers and retains only actionable error signals.
- **Security Distiller**: New `SecurityDistiller` for CVE scanners (Trivy, Snyk, Semgrep) — collapses verbose scan reports into concise vulnerability summaries.
- **VCS Distiller**: New `VcsDistiller` for version control tools beyond Git (Mercurial, SVN) with output-aware heuristics.
- **Expanded Tool Registry**: Added granular `cargo` subcommand support and new tool categories for Database, Mobile, Cloud, and CI/CD toolchains with accurate distiller routing.

### Improved
- **OpenClaw Portability**: The OpenClaw integration natively fetches plugin files directly from the public GitHub repository, allowing successful 1-click installation without requiring a full local git repository clone.
- **Robust RegEx Generation (`omni learn`)**: Fixed a critical bug where auto-learned numeric patterns used literal `#` instead of functional `\d+` in generated TOML filters. Now delegates TOML string escaping to the `toml` crate for correctness.
- **Enhanced Verify Report (`omni learn --verify`)**: Results are now grouped by source (Built-in vs. User), with clear per-category pass/fail counts and actionable tips when user-learned filters fail.
- **Auto-Clear Learn Queue**: `omni learn --apply` now automatically clears `~/.omni/learn_queue.jsonl` after successful application, preventing stale data from polluting subsequent `--discover` runs.
- **Premium Discover Table (`omni learn --discover`)**: Replaced raw text output with a structured `comfy-table` layout featuring color-coded actions (Strip/Count) and pattern previews.
- **Doctor Filter Diagnostics**: `omni doctor` now reports specific warnings for skipped filters (e.g., missing `match_command`) instead of generic error messages, and `--fix` can auto-repair invalid TOML files.
- **Distiller Robustness**: Replaced strict prefix checks with case-insensitive substring matching across all distillers for more reliable command detection.
- **Filter Loading**: Made `match_command` optional in `FilterConfig`, gracefully skipping filters with empty or missing patterns instead of crashing.

### Fixed
- **Learned Filters Concurrency (`learned.toml`)**: Replaced seconds-based timestamp resolution with `timestamp_micros()` for auto-generated filters to prevent fatal TOML duplication parse errors during high-frequency concurrent learning (fixes the infinite `doctor --fix` `.bak` failure loop).
- **Test Regression (`test_claude_code_stdout_format`)**: Resolved a persistent CI failure caused by state contamination from user-learned filters leaking into the test environment.
- **Stats UX Hint**: Added `--all-commands` usage hint to `omni stats` when showing truncated top-10 results.

## [0.5.6-rc2] - 2026-04-12
